To complete this task i have followed folliwng steps

1- First i have created 2 fields projectseniormanager and projectmanager in tblprojects of our database

2- Both fields are integer type and foreign keys of tblstaff where they are pointing staffid

3- I have created two Html input fields in application/views/admin/projects/project.php and HTML fields name are projectseniormanager and projectmanager

4- As we know Application/controller/admin/Projects.php is handling project dataflow

5- In application/models/Projects_model.php i have received these two values projectseniormanager and projectmanager in add($data) function
and then inserted in database

6- I have also created two functions  getSeniorProjectManager($id='') and getProjectManager($id='') in   application/models/Projects_model.php 

7- At This position both add and update projects worked very well

8- To show latest created  fields projectseniormanager and projectmanager i have fetched managers detail in view function of Projects.php controller (Application/controller/admin/Projects.php) and passed it to the admin/projects/View.php 

9- Then in admin/projects/View.php they loaded admin/projects/project_overview to show project detail and managers detail

10- i have added translation keywords in application/language/english/english_lang.php for this task
